# dmtls

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dmtls is to make the Sprague and Uniform methods of graduating
available without the need of rstan and other packages.

*Why are you creating this package and not using DemoTools?*

I had some problems trying to install DemoTools, especially because of rstan,
and after a few hours/days trying to solve it, my "easiest" solution was to copy
and paste its functions. 

## Installation

If you can, consider installing the 
[DemoTools](https://github.com/timriffe/DemoTools) package, dmtls was made
mainly for personal use. If you really want to use dmtls, feel free to install:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hhmacedo/dmtls")
```
