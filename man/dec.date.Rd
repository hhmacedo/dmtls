\title{Convert date to decimal year fraction.}
\usage{
dec.date(date)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{Either a \code{Date} class object or an unambiguous character
string in the format \code{"YYYY-MM-DD"}.}
}
\value{
Numeric expression of the date, year plus the fraction of the year
passed as of the date.
}
\description{
Convert a character or date class to decimal, taking into account leap years.
}
\details{
This makes use of the \code{lubridate::decimal_date} to compute the
proportion of the year that has passed. If the date is numeric, it is
returned as such. If it is \code{"character"}, we try to coerce to date
through \code{lubridate::ymd}, ergo, it is best to specify a character string
in an unambiguous \code{"YYYY-MM-DD"} format.  If \code{date} is given in a
\code{"Date"} class it is dealt with accordingly.
